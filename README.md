[*SparkX USB Hub - USB2514B (Qwiic) (SPX-18014)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/18014)

The USB2514 is a 4-port 2.0 USB hub. Who cares about USB 2.0 these days? The vast majority of projects we work on have a simple USB-to-Serial IC on it that do not require gigabit datarates. The USB251xB is a simple hub IC allowing multiple USB things to live under one USB connection; this is especially useful when prototyping a new product where you want the user to plug in just one cable.

The USB2514X is 4 port, the USB2513X is 3 port, and the USB2512X is 2 port. This library should work with all USB251xB ICs and may work with USB251x (non-B) variant ICs.

SparkFun labored with love to create this code. Feel like supporting open source hardware?
